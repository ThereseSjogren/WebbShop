        <h2>About our company</h2>
        <p>
            Our company was founded in Sweden in a city called Helsingborg in 2016 by four students.
            The most important task that we have on the web shop is to ensure that customers find clothes
            they like and that matches their lifestyle. We shortened down our selection to provide clothes
            with high quality, fast delivery and good prices.
